Recently I received some complains from our US users about the timestamp of our SharePoint site hosted in Office 365. The timestamp of the documents and folders on the site are all showing Australia Eastern time for them. It takes me sometime to find out how to allow each individual user to see their local timestamp. This requires some setting changes from the user end. Here is what needs to be done.  
  

1. Log into Office 365 SharePoint site and click your name in the top right corner, then the drop down list will appear with **About me** option.

2. Click **About me**, then click **edit** in the next page.

3. In the next page, click **…** icon next to **Details.** Then select **Language and Region**

4. In the next page, under **Choose your settings**, select **Always use my personal settings**. This will override the SharePoint site settings. Make sure **Time Zone** is set to correct local time zone.

5. **VERY IMPORTANT**, after make all these changes, please scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save all and close**.

6. You will get a prompt after save the change. As it indicates the change will take some time. So you won’t be able to see US timestamp in the SharePoint site straight away. Please wait for a few hours and try log into Office 365 again. You should then be able to view the SharePoint Site with US timestamp.
